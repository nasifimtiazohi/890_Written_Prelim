# Introduction:
Software development is an error-prone activity. 
Code written and reviewed by skilled developers 
may end up with various types of bugs 
some of which can be security-critical, i.e. vulnerability. 
Developers use security testing tools (e.g. static analysis, fuzzing) 
in order to identify the potential vulnerabilities. 
However, given the non-perfect nature of these tools 
and the cost of fixing the alerts they generate, 
developers response to such alerts may vary. 
Further, even after extensive security testing, 
undetected vulnerabilities may still remain in code 
that get discovered years after it was introduced.

Memory-related bugs, 
such as buffer overflows and uninitialized reads, 
are an important class of security vulnerabilities 
typically more prevalent in non memory-safe languages such as C, C++. 
Security testing techniques such as static analysis 
can detect a wide range of potential memory issues in the code. 
Tools performing such analysis 
present their results as alerts to the developers. 
However, it is yet to be studied 
how frequently does memory-related alerts are identified by security tools 
and how developers respond to them. 
Further, vulnerabilities that leak through all cautionary testing, 
may get discovered years later. 
If reported to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
the discovered vulnerabilities are tracked 
in a central database with a unique identifier called CVE.
However, it is yet to be studied if these vulnerabilities (CVEs) 
appeared in the code because 
security testing techniques failed to identify them or 
the testing could have had indeed identified the flaw but 
the developers did not take a corrective action in time.

In this paper, 
we study 10 C/C++ projects 
that have been using a static analysis security testing tool. 
We analyze the historical scan reports 
generated by the tool for these projects and 
study how frequently memory-related alerts appeared.
We also studied the subsequent developer action on those alerts. 
Moreover, for one of this project, Linux, 
we look at the CVEs that were published and 
investigate if the involved flaw in those vulnerabilities 
were identified by the security tool 
when they were first introduced in the code. 
We state our research questions as:

**RQ1:** How frequently memory-related alerts are identified by a static analysis security testing tool? 
        How do developers respond to these alerts?
**RQ2:** How many CVEs were identified by a static analysis security testing tool 
        when the involved flaws were first introduced in the code?

In the following sections,
we first explain our dataset
and then report the findings
followed by a discussion 
on implication and possible threats 
of results presented.
